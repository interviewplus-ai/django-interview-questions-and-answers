## 1. What is Django and why is it used?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and scalable web applications. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and includes features such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, URL routing, templating, and form handling.

## 2. How do you create a new Django project?

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

## 3. How do you define a model in Django? Provide an example.

```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    publication_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

## 4. How do you create a new record in the database using Django's ORM?

```python
book = Book(title='The Great Gatsby', author='F. Scott Fitzgerald', publication_date='1925-04-10')
book.save()
```

## 5. How do you query records from the database using Django's ORM?

```python
books = Book.objects.all()

```

## 7. How do you define a URL pattern in Django? Provide an example.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('books/', views.book_list, name='book-list'),
]
```

## 8. How do you create a view function in Django? Provide an example.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Book

def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'book_list.html', {'books': books})
```

## 9. How do you render a template in Django? Provide an example.

```python

    publication_date = forms.DateField(label='Publication Date')

def add_book(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = BookForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Process the form data
            title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            author = form.cleaned_data['author']
            publication_date = form.cleaned_data['publication_date']
            # Save the book to the database or perform other actions
    else:
        form = BookForm()
    return render(request, 'add_book.html', {'form': form})
```
